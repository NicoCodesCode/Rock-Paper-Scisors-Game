# Rock Paper Scissors  

I created this simple **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. ðŸŽ®  
It's the classic game you know and love: choose between rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer will randomly pick an option too. Based on the choices, you'll either win, lose, or draw!
